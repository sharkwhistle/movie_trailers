# movie_trailers

This is my first project for the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Program!

It is a website which displays the box art 6 of my favorite movies, which can be clicked on to show the movie's trailer'

To view the website, open the file entertainment_center.py using IDLE, or similar IDE and simply run the code.

This will open up the website in a web browser.

In order to view the Movie trailers, simply click on the Movie box-art image!
